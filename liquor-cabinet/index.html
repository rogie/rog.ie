                                    So many of our social evenings are filled with food, drinks, and conversation, and
                                    often, me, mixing some tasty drinks or pouring a finger of bourbon for my guests.
                              </p>
                              <p>I had never owned a liquor cabinet. Often, I would just find an area to cram some
                                    bottles in, but it was time.
                                    So many liquor cabinets focus on the liquor itself as the focal point. To me, I'd
                                    much
                                    rather
                                    something beautiful to look at that showcases craft and design, than a statement
                                    like "look at my expensive booze." </p>
                              <p>I've always loved wood. In earlier versions of my websites, I had illustrated wood
                                    grain adorning my navigation and button elements.
                                    I've poured over furniture websites, admiring the craft of woodworking, but never
                                    quite taken the leap to building my own.
                              </p>
                              <p>Quentin shares this love of beautiful wooden objects and craft, but at a much more
                                    obsessive level. As he's grown in his craft, I've wanted to have some of his work in
                                    my home.
